## Zooming Online: Solutions to Optimize Zoom Meetings

Remote working has been redefined through Zoom, a platform for video conferencing. Zoom enables individuals to collaborate remotely on a large scale, encouraging discussion and participation. Victoria Xu, the Technical Writing Lead at Bit Project, appreciates the organization remote meetings bring. “I think they've been helpful in clearing up confusion with the number of tasks we've assigned,” she says. At Bit Project, collaboration with team members to create workshops, articles, and tutorials is essential to provide our open-source platform for STEM topics. In these times of isolation, Zoom has been particularly useful in recreating the social dynamics of the workplace online. However, members agree that the efficiency of Zoom meetings has room for improvement. “Sometimes, we get off-topic [during meetings], even if it's for another task we need to do,” Victoria notes. Below are some solutions to the challenges that remote organizations face during meetings.

- **Prepare Meeting Goals and Assignments**

Getting organized prior to meetings allows for clearer communication between members. A lack of a plan often results in distracted meetings, leading to less productivity. Notifying members of their assignments prior to a meeting informs them of what needs attention, giving them the opportunity to bring up stronger clarifying questions or concerns. You can also prepare an outline of discussion points, updates, and estimated due dates for the meeting. This gives meeting attendees a picture of the goals they must achieve within a certain timeframe.

- **Team Building Activities**

Working together as a team is an essential part of Bit Project’s goal to democratize STEM education. Meetings should be more collaborative and fun to stimulate productivity, motivation, and transparency between the attendees. Adding a team-building exercise at the beginning of Zoom meetings can make them more engaging. This can be a game or any brainstorming exercise, such as “Two Truths and a Lie” or themed trivia. Adding an ice-breaker boosts team morale and encourages older members to connect and cooperate with new members.

- **Structured Note-taking**

The meeting notes keep track of information discussed during meetings, providing context when members need to revisit them to perform their tasks. We have a template for note-taking and we record our Zoom meetings, making it easier to find where certain points were covered. To create a template and subsequent meeting notes, you can use the Markdown feature on Github. Markdown lets you create different types of lists, add images and tables, and tag any issues relevant to a specific task. Make sure to add interesting points made during the meeting to keep track of new information. The moderator or note-taker can share meeting notes with other members either during or after the meeting to clarify and summarize the meeting’s key points.

- **Adding Video to Liven Up the Meeting**

A key part of Bit Project is interpersonal collaboration. Seeing each other face-to-face stimulates more participation from members. In addition, [55%](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-words/201109/is-nonverbal-communication-numbers-game) of communication depends on body language, so using the Zoom video feature can improve cooperation and understanding among members. Add informational aids, such as pictures or videos, to help members visualize information during the meeting. Encourage use of the video feature, but limit one-sided conversations to make the meeting productive. Use breakout groups on Zoom to allow members of different teams to interact and ask questions regarding meeting topics.

- **Retrospection At the End of the Meeting**

Recapping the meeting towards the end efficiently summarizes the goals and agenda of the meeting, emphasizing the purpose of the meeting to all members. Use the last five minutes to review topics and goals discussed during the meeting. The note-taker can also revise notes during this time. Recaps should be brief and concise, yet clear enough that the details on the meeting agenda and notes are included. Members can provide feedback on how the meeting went, offering suggestions for the future. The note-taker can also share meeting notes with members to address any questions and concerns. This is best done either on a chat-based work platform like Slack or on an open-source platform like a Github repository.

- **Assigning Action Items**

A part of the Github meeting template is assigning action items which list the activities members are responsible for completing. Referencing Airtable for due dates also helps to map deadlines for such activities. Airtable should display updated due dates for assignments in order to be reliable. Reviewing any assigned issues on Github is also another way to be on track — new members involved with the onboarding process should complete issues in a timely manner. Be sure to post any questions or concerns in the appropriate Slack channels! Everyone at Bit Project works together as a community, and receiving input from other members eliminates potential confusion.

In times of isolation, remote collaboration allows Bit Project to fulfill its goals to support STEM education. “Zoom meetings have allowed our organization to grow into a community of students who are passionate about contributing to open source education,” Shreya Gupta, the Director of Marketing notes. Zoom meetings enable Bit Project to work together to continue creating and innovating.
