**Subject:** Opportunity for University Students to Contribute to Open Source

Hi,

My name is **[NAME]** and I’m currently a **[FIRST/SECOND/THIRD/FOURTH/...]** year **[MAJOR]** major at UC Davis. I am reaching out to you on behalf of Bit Project (bitproject.org), which is an open source, fully remote student initiative to make developer education more accessible to prepare students to enter the tech industry.

We wanted to reach out to specifically to see if you could help us reach out to passionate CS students at your university who would be interested in getting involved in our initiative. We work with leading companies like MongoDB, Twitter, and Postman to develop curriculum on a broad range of topics such as Web Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Blockchain.

I’d love to set up a call sometime this week to give you more information or discuss this further. Please let me know if you’d be interested.

Thank you,

Hi,

My name is **[NAME]** and I’m currently a **[YEAR]** year **[MAJOR]** major UC Davis student. I reached out to you last week to see if you could help me share the open source technical education opportunity at Bit Project (bitproject.org) with CS students at your university.

I’d love to discuss this over a Zoom call if you're interested in learning more. Please let me know.

Best,
