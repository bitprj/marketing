Github is a software development platform where developers can collaborate on different projects. At Bit Project, we use Github to create, review, and edit projects, with different teams involved in steps along the way. This blog is a learning supplement that will help you navigate Github and understand some key Github terminology. No coding experience is required. 

# Locating & Opening Repositories 

Once you have created a Github account, you can be directed to the following page: {insert screenshot}
Notice on the left we have two repositories labeled “bitprj/marketing” and “bitprj/onboarding.” A repository is a folder containing multiple files. The “bitprj/marketing” repository here contains files relevant to the marketing team’s tasks or assignments. Once we click on the repository, we come to the following page: {insert screenshot}

We can see we are in the “Code” tab, which has multiple files below. One of the more important tabs used frequently is the “Issues” tab. Think of the “Issues” tab as an email inbox — it keeps track of updates made to a project. You can see comments made by other team members, and you can see the “assignee” to the issue, who is the person primarily responsible to work on the issue. Play around with the multiple filters in the Issues tab to see your assignments or created files. 

In order to view comments and edits made to a project by other members, view the “pull requests” tab. A “pull request” is a proposed change made by another member. When a member is editing a file, their edit is a “commit” that can be pushed. Once the desired edits to a file have been made, the pull request can be “merged” to reflect new changes in the file. 

**Activity #1**: Try creating a file in a repository. You can add any content to your file. Once you have finished, title the file according to the following format: “marketing / navigating_github.md” and submit. 

# Making Pull Requests & Editing Files 

Once a file is made, it can be shared with other members for review and editing. To do this, a pull request must be created. The first step is to go to the repository of choice (one that you have access to). Then, choose the branch that contains all of your edits (“commits”). A branch is a version of the repository where you can make edits without changing the original version. 
Select “pull request,” which will direct you to a page where you can specify to which branch the edits can be merged. {insert screenshot}

Note: All files that you initially see are in the master branch. The edits you make to a file will be in a separate branch. Once editing is complete, these two branches will be “merged” as mentioned earlier. 

To edit a file created by another member, you must be granted access to the file. 

**Activity #2**: Create a pull request for the file you created in Activity #1. Remember to check that the branch that you have created for the file is different from the master branch of the repository! 

While Github can seem to be a challenging platform to use, completing these tasks can help users become more familiar with Github. This Github glossary on commonly used terms (such as repository, pull request, commit, etc.) is another excellent supplement to guide learning when navigating Github. At Bit Project, Github is a platform where members can share their ideas, so understanding the basics ensures that smooth communication throughout our team
. Be sure to ask and clarify questions about Github with fellow members through the Slack channel!
